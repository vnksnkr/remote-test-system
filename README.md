To allow for testing the AXIOM Remote, in an automated way, an interface (AXIOM Beta shield and Add-On PCB) was designed which allows to press buttons and turn dials on the AXIOM Remote from the AXIOM Beta. The shield is connected to one of the routing fabric FPGAs.This repository contains the gateware developed to interface the shield with the Remote and a test framework to run automated tests.
